  Background
</h>

<ul>
  <li>Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) has been a major global health problem, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide</li>
  <li>Although CHB can be screened and controlled by treatment, some regions in Africa may not have access to sophisticated testing tools such as viral load and elastography due to limited resources
  </li>
</ul>


<h> 
  Objective
</h>

<ul>
  <li>To predict the risk of progressive CHB</li>
  <li>Evaluate the performance of different statistical machine learning models </li>
</ul>
