  Background
</h>

<ul>
  <li>Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) has been a major global health problem, affecting more than 200 million people worldwide</li>
  <li>Although CHB can be screened and controlled by treatment, some regions in Africa may not have access to sophisticated testing tools such as viral load and elastography due to limited resources
  </li>
</ul>


<h> 
  Objective
</h>

<ul>
  <li>To predict the risk of progressive CHB</li>
  <li>Evaluate the performance of different statistical machine learning models </li>
</ul>

<h> 
  Study Population
</h>

<ul>
  <li>551 patients seen at a public hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia who were ≥18 years, transplant- naive, and without liver fibrosis at baseline (Fibroscan ≤6.0 kPa)</li>
  <li>Basic demographics, medical history (e.g. family history of HCC, HIV status, substance abuse) and full diagnostic work-up (e.g. laboratory tests and Fibroscan) collected at baseline </li>
  <li>Patients were followed up to 7 years with Fibrosis scan and laboratory tests performed at 3-month (AST, ALT, CBC), or 6-month intervals (HBV viral load, HBsAg) </li>
</ul>
